def Minimize_Merit_Function(data, CandPoint, NumberNewSamples,w_r):
    '''Minimize_Merit_Function computes the distance and response surface
    criteria for every candidate point. The values are scaled to [0,1], and
    the candidate with the best weighted score of both criteria becomes the
    new sample point. If there are more than one new sample point to be
    selected, the distances of the candidate points to the previously
    selected candidate point have to be taken into account.

    Input:
    Data: struct-variable with all problem information
    CandPoint: matrix with candidate points
    NumberNewSamples: number of points to be selected for next costly evaluation 
    
    Output:
    xselected: matrix with all seleced points for next evaluation
    normval: cell array with distances to previously evaluated points and
    other selected candidate points, needed for updating PHI matrix later
